# Connected regions on the mesh

The query on the mesh provides a row of methods to extract the connected regions of the mesh.

The following methods are available in the `tessellate` module:
- `extract_connected_regions`: Extracts all connected regions from the mesh.
- `extract_largest_connected_region`: Extracts the largest connected region from the mesh.
- `extract_connected_regions_by_vertexes`: Extracts connected regions based on specified vertices.
- `extract_closest_connected_region`: Extracts the connected region closest to a specified vertex.

The running example can be found
