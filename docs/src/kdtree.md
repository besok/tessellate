# KDTree

A KDTree (k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space.
K DTrees are useful for applications 
that involve multidimensional search keys, such as range searches and nearest neighbor searches.  
For more information, you can visit the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) page on KDTrees.

The running example can be found
in the <a href="https://github.com/besok/tessellate/tree/main/examples/sskd_tree" target="_blank">repository</a>

For details see [query](./query.md) and `` and `try_sskd_tree`, `try_kd_tree` methods.
