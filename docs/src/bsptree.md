# BSPTree

A BSPTree (Binary Space Partitioning Tree) is a data structure used in computer graphics, computational geometry, and
other fields to recursively subdivide a space into convex sets by hyperplanes. This structure is useful for rendering
scenes, collision detection, and other spatial queries.

For details see [query](./query.md) and `` and `try_bsp_tree`  method.
