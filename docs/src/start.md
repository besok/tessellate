# Definitions

This section provides an overview of the fundamental elements of the **mesh module**, which lies at the core of Tessellate. The module offers essential building blocks for working with meshes, enabling the creation, manipulation, and analysis of 3D geometries. Below are the primary elements and their roles:

- **Vertex**: Represents a point in 3D space with `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates.
- **Edge**: A line segment that connects two vertices.
- **Face**: A flat surface enclosed by edges, typically a triangle or polygon.
- **Mesh**: A collection of vertices, edges, and faces that together define the structure of a 3D object.
- **Properties**: Functions and data structures to compute and manage mesh characteristics, such as area and volume.
- **Attributes**: Metadata associated with the mesh, including colors, texture coordinates, and other descriptive properties.
- **MeshType**: Specifies the type of mesh, such as a point cloud, surface, or wireframe representation.
- **BoundingBox**: An enclosing box around the mesh, used for spatial queries and performance optimization.
- **Polygon**: A flat, multi-sided shape defined by vertices and edges, often used to construct mesh faces.
- **Color**: Defines the color properties of the mesh or its individual elements.
- **Transform**: Tools for applying transformations to the mesh, such as translation, rotation, and scaling.
- **Boolean Operations**: Functions to perform operations like union, intersection, and difference between meshes.
- **Query**: Tools to search and retrieve elements within the mesh, such as specific vertices, edges, or faces.
- **Shape**: Utilities for creating and editing geometric shapes that form the basis of the mesh.

Each of these elements plays a crucial role in building and working with 3D models, 
forming the foundation for advanced mesh operations and analysis.
